<h2>Rock,Paper,Scissors Game</h2>
<h4>Using HTML, CSS, JS</h4>
<p>This game is sure to come while learning Web Dev. Though the logic would be same for anyone who makes the game, I used CSS to make it different by styling it in a Dark Theme.</p>
<p>I used a randomColor generating function to generate random color and mixed it set interval function to continuously chnage the title's color. To smoothen the color change, I used transition property and eased it</p>
<p>Further, I used text-shadow and box-shadow to beautify my dark-theme. Whether it be the title, the message box or hovering the choice- images, I covered it everywhere</p>
