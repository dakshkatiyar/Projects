A superb piece of a processor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!",28 June 2022,Competition Sentiment
Beast processor with Intel UHD shared Graphics,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have paired this processor with Asus Prime Z690A motherboard and 32G 5200Mhz DDR5 ram. My usage is mostly for Adobe suite for 4K video rendering & photoediting (without dedicated eGPU) and ocassonal AAA title gaming like GTA5, Battlefield, Cpunk,etc.The processor works like a charm for rendering and Games upto 75Hz in 1080p ultra setting.Overall good processor for the price and more review to come in future edits.",29 March 2022,Competition Sentiment
No title,No rating,"The Intel Core i7-12700K has significantly enhanced my gaming and productivity experience. This processor combines raw power with excellent integrated graphics, making it an ideal choice for both gamers and professionals.",28 June 2024,Positive
No title,No rating,This cpu is very powerful and can run games (when paired with a good graphics card) up to 300+ FPS without any problems or stutters. Make sure that you keep it cooled with a good cooler as well. It is also a great price for the product you are getting.,26 June 2024,Positive
No title,No rating,"Big improvement going from 4 cores to 20 cores. Too bad about the price, though. It's unlocked and I've got it running at plus 41 percent. I guess I just verbally kissed my warranty goodbye.",24 June 2024,Positive
No title,No rating,"Well if I buy a computer the very first thing it has to do is boot. If it doesn't do that than all else is a failure. I will probably give it another try tomorrow, otherwise it will be going back.",24 June 2024,Negative
No title,No rating,"I like the integrated graphics as I'm not using it for high-end gaming. I was disappointment to find it didn't come with a cooler. I've been spoiled by AMD. Also it was difficult to fit it into the socket to the point that I was worried about damaging it. Things worked out in the end and I have no complaints about its operation now. Three months in, no problems.",24 June 2024,Competition Sentiment
No title,No rating,"Amazing CPU previously had a i3 12100f so for me it was an extreme upgrade. Extra, more stable fps in pretty much all my games. Can also tune with intel xtu which is a good feature to have.",22 June 2024,Positive

No title,No rating,"So, being an AMD fanboy, I was not keen on getting this, but the c/t (cores to threads) kinda caught my eye. Running 12 cores, and 20 threads (4 e-cores i think) I thought, well, for the price, it should be okay?I was wrong...This cpu is a monster in my eyes. Running with 32GB of ram (ddr4) and matched with the RTX 4070 GPU being cooled by the Artic Liquid Freezer ii, there is nothing stopping this from performing to its max. I would recommend this piece of kit to anyone, starting out or continuing on with building computers for their ""high end"" gaming etc. I have not once seen this struggle.",10 April 2024,Competition Sentiment

No title,No rating,Great product/Brand Intel i7 CPU. I have been using the Intel brand CPU's and have been using the i7 and the K series since they were introduced. This seems to handle video processing and CAD/CAM projects quite well. I have always had great luck with Intel brand processors and will continue using them.

No title,No rating,"Comme d'hab chez Intel c'est très bon, les perfs sont juste incroyable avec le boost natif, j'ai réussi a l'OC jusqu'à 5.2Ghz et je suis sur qu'on peut monter encore avec un water custom.Seul défaut c'est que très vite quand on prend une 4080 il tire un peu la langue en 4k.

No title,No rating,"This is my first intel build coming from past AMD builds (Ryzen, FX, Athlon, Phenom). I am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this CPU with instructions followed, this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026. I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all. If you have the extra 50-60$ go with the i9 i should have done that. AMD seems to be all the hype but I see why Intel won't be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip.",24 January 2024,Competition Sentiment

I returned it and will be upgrading to 13 or 14th Gen instead.,16 January 2024,Negative
No title,No rating,"the one i bought one year ago had instability. didn't know it was the CPU until it really started acting up. had to do a lot of tests with different component to finally be able to pinpoint the CPU. When i reached out to Intel, they Informed me about a policy about ''tray'' processor and ''boxed'' processor. basically a tray processor is sold in bulk and they don't cover warranty. As for Boxed processor, they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more. Fortunatly, the one i got was a boxed one, but still Intel told me i had a ''tray'' processor. i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a ''box'' processor. It was a bit unnerving, but at the en, they offered me the warranty and i'm supposed to receive a new one when they finish processing the one i sent them.",12 January 2024,Positive

No title,No rating,"At this time in the product life cycle, the 12th gen CPU is about half the cost of the 14th gen CPU.  It is more than fast enough for everything I do.  My major reason for upgrading was my old motherboard did not have TPM 2.0.  The CPU was easy to install, it is running between 36-37 degrees Celsius (though I admit I am not stressing it).  I am very happy with my purchase.",10 December 2023,Positive
No title,No rating,Great product,9 December 2023,Positive
No title,No rating,"Compared to the Coffee Lake generation I had been (willingly) stuck on for 4 years this is a massive leap. Before buying I was a bit skeptical since I'm not a fan of Intel's newer way of handling cores, but the first thing I tried when I got it was emulating PS3 games and right off the bat I saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubled.The older CPUs from the 8th, 9th, and 10th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if you're on a budget maybe look on the used market for those. But if you really need something powerful this is a good option.",4 December 2023,Positive

No title,No rating,"It's pretty good value for money (as far as intel CPUs are concerned...) for a 12th gen CPU, but if you're looking for the BETTER value get the i5-13600K which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen CPU. The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable.",5 August 2023,Positive
No title,No rating,"This item has been with me for a very short time.So I recently decided to upgrade my gaming rig, and after extensive research, I made the bold choice to order the Intel Core i7-12700K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 12 Cores. Let me tell you, this processor is the absolute best! With its 12 cores, it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience. Whether I'm playing graphically demanding AAA titles or indulging in intense multitasking, this processor effortlessly handles it all. And what's even better is that it comes with integrated graphics, meaning I didn't have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card, yet. The integrated Graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups. Plus, with Intel's reputation for reliable and high-quality products, I know I can trust the i7-12700K to last me for years to come.I hope you find this review helpful.",5 August 2023,Future Expectations
