No title,No rating,"Processore davvero fenomenale, sbloccato e probabilmente in grado di fornire prestazioni ancora superiori.Tutto molto bello se non fosse che almeno in questo esemplare non c'è stato verso di far funzionare la prima corsia PciE 16X e quindi risultato è stato completamente inutile, sicuramente per il gaming. Ho provato su tre schede madri differenti, b760 e z690, in tutti i casi e settaggi del bios non è stato possibile utilizzare il primo slot.Mentre gli altri slot venivano utilizzati correttamente e, ad esempio, nel secondo slot pciE la scheda video veniva riconosciuta, ma finzionava solo a gen3 X8.

Basically said it's it's 12th generation processor and that's been recent in the past two to three years. It is on the mid-range of the spectrum for Intel i5, but really just seems to automate on its own and it actively will try to lower utilization numbers once it's processed what it has to process.
