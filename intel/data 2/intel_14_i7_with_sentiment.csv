Worst quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,I don't liked the price of it .I Also don't liked the performance of it .Rather you can purchase i9 13th generation,28 March 2024,Negative
Waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,13 gen is better with same performence at low pricing. Avoid this product cause it have only 2 core touching 6000 mhz so in real life there are no difference.,7 December 2023,Negative
i9 14th gen is the beast!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just upgraded from i5 9400f to i9 14900k and super happy with the performance that I am able to achieve. It simply works buttery smooth. Large applications open like notepad apps.It heats a lot though so I went with MSI coreliquid liquid cooling solution.If looking to upgrade from 13th gen then save money because the performance is identical, however if setting up new PC then definitely go with it.My setup -MSI MPG z790 carbon wifiIntel i9 14900kMSI RTX 4070tiMSI MAG coreliquid liquid coolerSamsung 980 Pro - 1 TBRipjaws 32gb ddr5Bonus tip: If u are struck setting up ur PC then go to MSI support and they are super responsive to assist you.

It's just a overclocked i7 13700k,2.0 out of 5 stars,What's the meaning of having a new chip when it provides no generational uplift except only thing that is better than last gen is the hefty power consumption if ur fine with that this will work fine but I think ur electricity bill is gonna sky rocket 3 to 5 % uplift for 15 % more money is not worth it rather buy 13 or 12 gen with some ddr5 ram will help you more or else get r7 7700 will provide less like 10 percent for 50 percentage less power draw ryzen is just better when it comes to desktop processor in efficiency and value for money,25 October 2023,Positive

No title,No rating,The only reason I knocked down the rating under value for the money is because I feel Intel is charging too much for this product. But hey that's just my opinion. Anyways. Good product. Puts AMD to shame is all ways again in my opinion.,24 June 2024,Competition Sentiment
No title,No rating,"This is a nice processor that I use in a dev box.  I have it air cooled and can play Minecraft with shaders all day on it with my 4080GTX and 128 gigs of memory.  The only issue I have is probably my own fault, in that I learned that intel did that stunt where they introduced P and E cores.  I'm not sure if they are making straight performance core models by the time I write this but if you are a rabid gamer make sure you are getting that type of proc and not this proc.  Still, this proc will do just fine for me as I use this for hyper-v and development work.

No title,No rating,"In 2020 I made the mistake of switching to AMD. The system I built was so annoying. The fan would increase and decrease speed depending on the load, and it literally made the processor wait for the fan--at least that's how it seemed.

No title,No rating,"The Intel Core i9-14900K processor is a beast when it comes to gaming and multitasking. With its 24-core configuration (8 Performance-cores and 16 Efficiency-cores), this CPU handles everything from intense gaming sessions to heavy-duty content creation smoothly and without a hitch. The unlocked feature allows for overclocking, providing additional performance boosts as needed. Integrated graphics are a great addition, capable of handling basic video tasks and supporting displays without the need for a separate GPU. This processor consistently delivers high speeds and reliable performance, making it a top choice for anyone building a high-end PC. Whether you're gaming at the highest settings, streaming, or juggling multiple intensive applications, the i9-14900K stands up to the challenge.",4 June 2024,Positive
No title,No rating,"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly.",2 June 2024,Positive

No title,No rating,Defective from manufacturer constant game crashes because of power throttle issue. Intel needs to recall this product and refund everyone.  I replaced every part on my new PC build only to find out the issues was this Intel CPU (amazon 30 day warranty had already expired by then).  I'm now having to wait for months attempting to get a refund from intel.  This is a well-known issue and Intel refuses to admit and recall product,2 June 2024,Negative
No title,No rating,"System booted  fine with 2 ram sticks installed and it appeared that everything was fine at first but after some time issues started to show up.  Unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed.  At first I thought it was the motherboard or RAM.  But testing of different RAM ruled that out.  Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue.  Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU.  Now I'm waiting for Intel RMA process to have them test the CPU again and hopefully replace it.  When I did not have issues, it was a fast CPU, very impressed with that, just wish this showed up sooner.",2 June 2024,Future Expectations

No title,No rating,"The 13th and 14th gen intel cpu chips are notorious for being unstable and low quality. While installation is easy, the chip may come with deficiencies that get worse over time.For the first couple months after install i would experience BSoD crashes and i was trying to diagnose. Now 2 months later the computer will no longer boot without BSoD. All other hardware has been replaced meaning the chip is absolutely the issue. Currently in the process of RMA negotiations with intel because diagnosis took longer than the amazon return window. So far their service has been slow to respond. Until intel admits to the faults in these generations and offers an actual fix i would suggest sticking to AMD.

No title,No rating,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years.",31 May 2024,Competition Sentiment

No title,No rating,This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good .

No title,No rating,I have written a couple of dozen reviews on Amazon and this is only my second negative review.  I placed an order for a brand new Intel 14700K CPU from Amazon and it arrived as an Open Box (the factory seal had been cut and the processor was jammed into the packaging at an odd angle.  I installed it in my system and it would not boot - did not even get past the POST testing.  I uninstalled it and send back for a refund with a note that it was an open box and was defective.I give this only a single star across all categories as the processor arrived in an open box (I paid full price for a new CPU) and did not work in my system (it was defective on arrival) - it's a month later and I still have not received a refund.  I purchased an identical CPU from another source and that CPU booted up with no issues (it is running the PC I am typing this review on) so clearly an issue with the quality of the product that Amazon shipped to me.,3 May 2024,Competition Sentiment
No title,No rating,"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway. AI image generation/training - GPU, video rendering/editing/transcoding - GPU, even audio processing/correction is done on GPU these days.",3 May 2024,Positive
No title,No rating,"Because of the crash problem and we are told to turn down the performance in the CPU, We are not getting the performance we paid for.

No title,No rating,"I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars.",3 May 2024,Competition Sentiment

No title,No rating,"Switching from a 5800x3d for my 4080 super.. this is one heck of a cpu. I only put a $60 280mm aio ""I'd cooling"" and put it on smart fan. After that gaming has been a breeze with crazy high fps that give me 99% GPU usage in every game. Jedi survivor is getting over 130fps with dlss quality on. Which is unheard of from everything I read. Totally glad I went with this over 7800x3d. Mobo was much cheaper with every bell and whistle I wanted. My newest build is definitely nice enough to leave any builder drooling.. Thanks to this cpu at its core.",1 May 2024,Positive

No title,No rating,"Intel has pushed these 13th and 14th Gen i9's way too far in an effort to keep up with AMD. They come out of the box with maxed out settings, including a nearly unlimited 5000w (yes, thousand) available power draw. Intel customer support will ask you to manually configure the BIOS to a setting that effectively renders it a very expensive i7. Wait until they get this fixed, if it's even possible, unless you just really like underclocking and BSODs",27 April 2024,Competition Sentiment

No title,No rating,"I bought this as an upgrade from my trusty i9 10900k. I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out. Playing VR sims like il-2 and DCS has mostly eliminated little stutters and performance drops. Similarly, MSFS 2020 at ultra settings in populated areas provides a smooth and stable experience. My temps generally stay around 65 to 75 underload/demanding gaming. I have seen brief spikes to 80. I'm using an EVGA CLC 280mm cooler. I may need to reapply thermal paste.",23 April 2024,Positive
No title,No rating,The one received was a silicon lottery loser that required excessive and abnormally high voltage and had horrible SP-ratings. It was returned because the poor silicon quality made it unsuitable for the purpose for which it was purchased. I purchased a 14900KF from Amazon to replace it and it was equally poor quality and had to go back. Intel needs to cull their trash samples and sell them at a lower price. A CPU that needs 1.500V to run stock turbo clocks is unacceptable and impossible to properly cool.,22 April 2024,Negative
