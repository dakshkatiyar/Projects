No title,No rating,I bought this because my i9-12900k was giving me problems.  It was more for troubleshooting.  The i3-12100 actually works better than my problematic i9-12900k that had lagging and stuttering issues that made it nearly impossible to work with Microsoft Word or Excel.  I never thought I'd see the day that an i3 would outperform an i7 or i9 but this little budget CPU works better than them.,2 May 2024,Positive

No title,No rating,Je l'ai acheté pour monter un bon PC bureautique voire plus si affinités...Avec ses 4 cœurs/8 Threads de 12ème génération : ça fait une sacrée différence par rapport à un i3 de 6ème génération (qui n'avait que 2 cœurs 4 threads).Maintenant les i3 sont même bien utilisables pour du gaming s'ils sont couplés avec une carte graphique style RTX3060 ou RX6650XT voir RTX 4060Ti ou RX7700XT.Il chauffe vraiment peu et est tellement bien calibré que le ventirad d'origine suffit à le refroidir même lors d'un stress test CPU-Z.,20 March 2024,Negative

No title,No rating,"I have this installed into an Asrock motherboard. It works great. I was a little misinformed about the built in graphics and thought when I bought it was I was getting Iris Xe, but it's something called UHD. The product description clearly says UHD, so my bad really. Most of the other Intel 12th gen chips with graphics processing have Iris Xe which has many more graphics processing units. For sure the UHD is fine for many things including streaming video. Not sure about 3D gaming, though. Had I know it was UHD and not Iris, I might have saved $30 or so and bought the version without the graphics. On the other hand, I liked the idea of onboard graphics as a backup or alternative. In either case, this i3 runs like a champ compared to the quad core phenom ii based system it's replacing.I'm not sure it's relevant here but I think I should mention that my Asrock board can't make use of the on board UHD graphics when you set BIOS to legacy mode. You need to use the UEFI mode in order to use the on board graphics. Not sure if that's typical of other boards or board brands. With my Asrock board, you need a discrete graphics card to use the legacy bios mode to boot from an old non-UEFI installation of windows. If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it.",29 September 2023,Positive

Loading time is very good. You really don't need amazing graphics to perform any of these tasks. I'm using integrated video and it suits me just fine. My other computer uses the APU on an AMD 5600G and I've never had issues. I paired this CPU with a barebones Gigabyte motherboard (cheapest I could find) and 8GB of DDR4 memory and it rivals my AMD setup for plain tasks.Don't feel like you need an i5, i7, or even the i3 12400 if you just need an everyday computer for watching videos, doing online banking, or crunching out work material (unless you are editing heavy media). This i3-12100 is the equivalent of a quad core processor from years back. If you are working on virtual machines, doing strong programming, have a million windows open, need to use Adobe Creative Suite to quickly produce and export content, then you may want to consider moving up to a stronger processor. Even so, this one is still pretty good - it will just take longer to complete some things.I'm overall very happy with this processor and I think most households who have similar requirements will be satisfied.
