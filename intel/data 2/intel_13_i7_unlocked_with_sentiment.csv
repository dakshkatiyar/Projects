No title,No rating,"Upgraded to the 13700k from the 11900k and the jump in performance was nothing short of massive. This 13th gen i7 K is officially Intel's fourth fastest CPU on paper but in real life it's the fastest of them all in terms of stability as the the three slated above it (13900k,14700k and 14900k) are all plagued with issues that Intel won't discuss but admits to, albeit grudgingly. Until a fix-all patch is released, the 13700k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who won't be bothered with unpredictable bugs and BSOD fests. What good is it having a Ferrari but with an engine that's goes offline 20 times a day?  May as well go with a Porsche that works. At that level of performance these high-end CPU's more or less all perform equal (or would if they all worked properly), but it's easy to understand the frustration of owners whose 30-day window for return to Amazon is closed.",13 June 2024,Positive

No title,No rating,"Purchased on sale for $334. The 13700k is the best value CPU if you require enough speed for high-end gaming + productivity (e.g. video editing/rendering, streaming, multitasking, etc). This thing is fast. I was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5.5 Ghz (all p-core) and 4.4 Ghz (all e-cores). I could go higher if I wanted to spend more time on it, but this was a quick overclock. Perfectly stable and runs (relatively)cool with the undervolt. Intel is still my preference for CPUs and I don't foresee that changing, especially with all of the issues I've read regarding AMD chips (boot up issues, crashes, poor multi-core performance).",16 May 2024,Competition Sentiment

No title,No rating,"I bought this to replace my 10850k after I realized how much it was holding back my 4090.  I bought an ASRock z790 PG lightning /d4 board to go with it so I could use my existing DDR4 ram.  The difference was night and day!  I have an ID-Cooling 280mm AIO (cheapest I could find on Amazon) with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on Cinebench R23 unless I run 3 or 4 passes back to back.  I am thrilled with how well this CPU runs.I was able to bump my DDR4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1 (timings cl20/26/26/26/48) after a bios update from ASRock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast!  I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed.  I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is.  I have no regrets about not bumping up to the 13900k, I do gaming and code compiling and it is a dream for both of those workloads.",8 March 2024,Positive

No title,No rating,"Intel Core i7-13700K: Gaming Beast with Brawn and Bandwidth, But Not Without BiteOverall Rating: 4.5 out of 5 starsFor: Serious gamers, demanding content creators, overclocking enthusiasts, those upgrading from older systemsAgainst: Pricey compared to previous generations, runs hot, requires beefy coolingPerformance: 5 out of 5 starsThe i7-13700K packs a serious punch. Its hybrid architecture with 8 performance cores and 8 efficient cores tackles demanding tasks with ease. Whether you're pushing pixels in the latest AAA titles or crunching numbers in complex spreadsheets, this CPU thrives under pressure. In gaming, expect silky-smooth frames at 1440p and beyond, even in the most demanding titles. Compared to its predecessor, the i7-12700K, it offers a noticeable performance boost, especially in multi-threaded workloads.Overclocking: 4.5 out of 5 starsThe i7-13700K is an overclocker's dream. It offers plenty of headroom for pushing clock speeds, unlocking even more performance potential. However, remember that this comes at the cost of increased power consumption and heat generation. Ensure you have a robust cooling solution like a high-end air cooler or AIO liquid cooler to keep things under control.Features: 4 out of 5 starsThe i7-13700K boasts impressive specs: PCIe 5.0 support for next-gen hardware, DDR5 memory compatibility, and Intel UHD Graphics 770 for basic graphics needs. This future-proofs your build and ensures you're ready for the latest tech as it emerges. However, keep in mind that the cost of DDR5 memory might still be a drawback for some.Value: 4 out of 5 starsWhile the i7-13700K delivers fantastic performance, it comes at a premium price tag. Compared to previous generations, the cost per core has increased. However, it still offers compelling value compared to its closest competitor, the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, especially for gaming. Remember, you'll need to factor in the cost of a capable cooler and potentially DDR5 memory, further impacting the overall value proposition.Things to Consider:Heat and Power Consumption: This CPU runs hot, especially under overclocking. Invest in a robust cooling solution to avoid thermal throttling.Price: The i7-13700K is expensive compared to older generations and slightly pricier than its main competitor. Consider your budget carefully.DDR5 Compatibility: While future-proof, DDR5 memory is still more expensive than DDR4. Factor this into your overall build cost.Final Verdict:The Intel Core i7-13700K is a top-tier processor for serious gamers, demanding content creators, and overclocking enthusiasts. Its blistering performance, PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support, and overclocking headroom make it a future-proof powerhouse. However, the high price, heat generation, and DDR5 compatibility requirements might be dealbreakers for some. If you're looking for the ultimate in gaming and multi-core performance and have the budget for a premium build, the i7-13700K is a worthy investment. Just be prepared to feed it some serious watts and keep it cool.Note:This review is based on my own research and comparison of benchmarks.

In general - all mentioned in this review products are as described and working as described. Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system.Items used in this build:--Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/Very good case – compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included – actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon.--Item 2) EZDIY-FAB PCIE 4.0 16x Extreme High Speed Flexible Riser Cable PCI Express Port GPU Extension Card-Dual Reverse Connector for ITX [21cm]. Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09S5DW3RX/-Does the job - exactly what I need for the project. Note: During system build I have to remove the bracket from the cable male connector and install it back after passing cable through the case hole.--Item 3) Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/- Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher.--Item 4) CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BCF57FL5/- Good CPU, working well in gaming.--Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/- Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory.In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience.--Item 6) Memory: TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Ram 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNTV1945/-Very good product, works as described, nice looking, recognized by Aura Sync.--Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/- Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and:a)  MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/b) Intel Core i9-13900KF,  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTX™ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/). This compact GPU has included Graphics Card Holder which will work with presented builtI own all of these (a,b,c) components packed in another fancy mini ITX case (Phanteks PH-ES217A_BK02 Evolv Shift 2 Air Mini-ITX case, Fabric Side Panels) and they performed superb in games.--Item 8) SSD Disks:8.1) Primary (system): WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X NVMe Gen4 PCIe M.2 2280 WDS200T2X0E, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7CMZ3QH/8.2) Secondary (backup and media data): Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 CT4000P3PSSD8, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B25M8FXX/- Very good products, works as described, no problems.--Item 9) Antec Power Supply Sleeved Cable, PSU Cables, PSU Extension Cable Kit / 1x24pin ATX / 2x8pin (4+4) EPS / 3X (6+2) pin PCI-E, 30cm Length with Combs, Dual EPS Red Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BN3H2K17/- Perfect fit for this project, good cables, looks nice.--Item 10)CPU cooler: ID-COOLING IS-67-XT Black 67mm Height Low Profile CPU Cooler, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFPY9CKZ/- Good design, keeps i7-13700K adequately cool in open Air PC Case. Mounting for regular size 120mm fan included. Easy installation - just install radiator 1st and mount fan after. ID-COOLING IS-67-XT chosen because of black color. In my opinion DeepCool AN600 Low Profile CPU Cooler (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P8ZPWT/) has a little bit better cooling performance (I have one in a very compact Flex ATX build).--Item 11) EZDIY-FAB Moonlight 120mm RGB PWM Case Fan, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8T79QY/Good, quiet and nice-looking fan. Actually, it is a leftover piece from a 9 fans ATX tower system build. If you want to build a similar system with a similar look, I recommend Cooler Master MF120 Halo² Fan Duo-Ring ARGB (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWKZGYXJ/). This fan has a similar look but has better airflow / air pressure.---Item 12) 24 Pin RGB Cable Extension Kit (used ARGB strip only), Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN4G7KC/- The power cable connector to MB too tight - did not go all the way down, afraid to broke the MB if try to apply more force (the regular PSU cable fits perfect). Connector to PSU too tight as well, but was able to connect all the way down. Actually, in reality the system with this cable does not look good (too much RGB). Did use ARGB strip only for decoration purposes on the GPU side.--Item 13) Thermal Paste: ARCTIC MX-6. Optional - I have a very good experience using this thermal paste brand and always using it for the builds (so thermal paste provided by ID-COOLING was not used). Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VDLH5M6/-----------Overall, I assume the goal is reached - the presented system can play recent games and look very cool (in my humble opinion).",8 January 2024,Positive

Average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles @ 65 watts, which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen. No need to undervolt this CPU, even though you can, you'll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do. During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how. Long story short if you want max performance to play around with just get a i9 processor, that's what those are made for, for everyone else there's this one!",26 December 2023,Future Expectations

No title,No rating,Super fast and stable CPU. Note that it can run hot because of the higher voltage it can use. I made sure to get a nice AIO for it. Coupled with an arctic freeze II 306 it rarely gets above 30C.,22 November 2023,Positive
No title,No rating,"I had a Ryzen 7 3800xt cpu for a while now so I went for a new upgrade and went for Intel for this generation. This processor works faster and better compared to what I had previously. This cpu is basicaly like an efficient i9 12900k, so if your looking for a high end processor just get this 13th gen. Also at this time the 14th gen i7 just got released but based on the reviews its more like a 13th gen Intel ks proccesor. That why I never went that route.",22 November 2023,Positive

No title,No rating,"I use this i7-13700K every day for about a year. I have Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (2x32GB) DDR5 4800MT/s CL40 Desktop Memory CT2K32G48C40U5 modules (4 of them), a Corsair RM1000x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply in a Phanteks Enthoo Pro Full Tower Chassis without Window Cases PH-ES614PC_BK in service for about one year as I write this review. For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph. I strongly recommend this cpu, dram, the power supply, the case, the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi 6E LGA 1700, the Asus video card, and am also recommending the Crucial MX500 SATA drives I use. Is it all of this the fastest? I have no idea. Does it boot and work reliably everytime so far? Absolutely!",1 November 2023,Positive
