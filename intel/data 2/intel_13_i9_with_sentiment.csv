Great performance,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cool processor,2 April 2024,Positive
It can be more efficient I guess,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It is working almost same as my 10 yr old DELL XPS laptop, swapped with a SATA SSD, and i7 second gen processor. I don't know whats improved. But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80¬∞C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80¬∞C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80¬∞c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS. Same kind of processors on Mac before Apple silicon came in were working more efficiently. So I guess it's prob with windows OS, but not processors.",10 November 2023,Competition Sentiment
It's a beast nothing much to say,5.0 out of 5 stars,This processor is all-rounder for every tasks you do on PC from small to CPU intensive applications. If you are looking for vast performance with heavy production tasks this is very nice to have. Best to use with Motherboard DDR5 and PCI-E 5.0 supported motherboards.,13 October 2023,Positive

No title,No rating,"I initially got a 13700K, but grabbed this after and snubbed the 14 gen. I upgraded from 8700K, ***which is still a very capable cpu even today, but due to the demands of certain programs the 13900K is handling them better than the 13700K so far.Fingers crossed to hoping it will not fail in future. There are well documented power issues that Intel and their partners have with the 13th, 14th gen. May be an upsell to the upcoming ultra line of cpus?So you have to take this into account and modify your motherboards bios, and follow Intel's suggested settings.I will update this review if anything else comes up.",10 June 2024,Future Expectations

No title,No rating,"We set up multiple computing servers to run heavy video processing algorithms essentially continuously everyday - to make a long story short, we liked how fast this ran compared to the i7-11th gen we had from before.The surprising thing is one day among 8 essentially identical machines, we noticed one desktop that seemed much hotter than the others.  We hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the CPUs and was shocked that this one was drawing 450W as others were showing < 200W.  And temperature went up to 100C while the others were at 70C.One system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot.  We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A.  We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly.  So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V.Ordered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up.  We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again.  This one we had to reduce workload to 75% of other systems to cool it down.So 2 out of 10 desktops are defective  This is a huge surprise.  These systems had no GPU, only motherboard, 64GB of DDR5, and an SSD.  Has anyone else seen this?",31 May 2024,Positive
No title,No rating,"I saved up for years to upgrade my PC, which I built from scratch to use for streaming. After a couple of months of using this new chip, I started getting constant game/system crashing whenever playing Destiny 2, or Fortnite. Basically has put my livestreaming/content creation job on hold, because of the constant crashing. Here are my specs...MOBO: ASUS Prime Z790-A WiFi 6ECPU: Intel Core i9-13900KGPU: XFX Speedster MERC310 AMD Radeon RX 7900XTRAM: 128GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM",30 May 2024,Competition Sentiment
No title,No rating,"So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU.",26 May 2024,Competition Sentiment

It works really good, very very fast, and can ***multi task heavy software like they're nothing*** and with a push pull AIO it averages around 28*C and when I'm gaming it stays around 50-40*C with graphics maxed out. Much love and gratitude to Intel! This works great with gaming and also data science, which work is the main reason I bought this. I also used the Thermal Grizzly - KryoSheet (38x38x0,2mm) for this as well so I don't have to worry about paste drying up on my i9 <3 and lemmy tell you it fits PERFECTLY and pairs well with a CPU contact frame too, and after almost half a year I've yet to have any problems, only good results.",3 May 2024,Positive
No title,No rating,"My first review ever. Intel has finally acknowledged this issue, search ""Regarding Reports of 13th/14th Gen Unlocked Desktop Users Experiencing Stability Issues"" on google.For me, worked great for about a month, then slowly started experiencing stability issues. Games would crash and get an occasional blue screen. After about 6 months, there were noticeable stability issues, with many games unable to boot past main menu, causing blue screen on launch, or experiencing frequent crashes. Friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues, showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes.After a year, my PC can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now. Discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds, I can't play any games. I had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize it's been the CPU all along. I also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this CPU and now I have to investigate if this CPU has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard. I expect Intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public.Please look up ""Intel 13th and 14th Gen stability"" for more info, or ""Intel Raptor Lake stability"" on Google for further cases.

No title,No rating,"So I am no tech guru or anything.  I cannot delve into the technical nuances of this cpu like some can.  What I can tell you is this.  The i9-13900k has significantly increased my productivity.  Being able to run multiple CPU heavy applications completely changed the way I work.

No title,No rating,"If youre going with an AIO get a 360mm cooler. I tried using a 240mm and it just wasnt enough to cool the CPU during some Starfield.

No title,No rating,"When it comes to going over the top for a PC upgrade, this CPU is the undisputed heavyweight champion. I, too, dabble in video editing, 3D modeling, and an array of demanding tasks, and let me tell you, this powerhouse just devours them with sheer gusto. Paired with a Kraken water cooler, it operates like a well-oiled machine, showing absolutely no signs of throttling, even under the most intense workloads. And as for those so-called ""CPU-intensive"" games, well, they might as well be child's play for this beast. If you're seeking the best of the best, look no further ‚Äì this CPU is the crown jewel in the kingdom of processors, and it's here to make your computing dreams come true. It's not just top-tier; it's top of the world, and it laughs in the face of anything you throw its way. A true marvel of technology that's worth every penny!",19 September 2023,Positive

No title,No rating,"This processor is a beast especially paired with gtx 4090 graphics card. I can edit videos and play games both at 4K settings together no problem and it doesn‚Äôt generate that much heat either. I previously had a 2080ti paired with 6900k and was very happy with it until everyone was transitioning to 4K so sadly I had to retire my old build. Just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090, don‚Äôt be a smartass and try to put it in small case, you will regret it later. I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you don‚Äôt want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent. Good luck gamers and editors. Just remember if gaming is the only thing you do then no point spending this much just go a step down on processor. AMD processors are better if gaming is the only thing you do.",10 August 2023,Competition Sentiment
