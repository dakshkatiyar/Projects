Nothing can beat intel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was using amd cpu untill now. Cpu died in 2 year only. Now back to intel. Dad of AMD .,15 January 2023,Competition Sentiment
This processor is a beast 🔥,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I brought this processor for my gaming/workstation build .Combining this processor with nzxt 360 mm liquid cooling AIO , things went smoothly.It can handle literally all heavy tasks like 3d rendering , simulation , gaming , yet keeps temprature at 40c .Highly recommended for best gaming rigs .Note: 4th gen ssd is a plus for the build ... Otherwise there might be bottleneck with gen3 ssds while doing 3d rendering works .",30 August 2022,Positive
Overpriced. Should be around 55-58 even with 18%GST.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Product is good Price is high wait for prices to go down dont buy overpriced products. It's gives seller more power over us.,22 February 2022,Positive

No title,No rating,I used this to upgrade a system I built two years ago.  I was going t use a 14th gen i9.  but for all the issues I have heard and read about with the 13th and 14th gen i9's having I went safe route.  I hate to have a computer crash cause of manufacture intel 13th and 14th gen i9 defects!!!!,22 June 2024,Negative
No title,No rating,Make sure you have a good Aio  NOT an msi core liquid v2 360 because that one died on me and this was seeing 80-90c idle other than that this processor is pretty good when its cooled properly.,6 June 2024,Positive

No title,No rating,"Had a 11900K prior to this one, and as fast as it was even being overclocked to 5.3 ghz - the 12900K is just simply better. Put a minor overclock to 5.2 ghz and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor. Resizable bar enabled and it's been awesome. Was worth every penny.",22 November 2023,Positive

No title,No rating,This CPU has 24 threads and 16 cores (8E cores and 8P cores) which really makes difference when dealing with 3d graphics and to prevent bottleneck issuesDoesn't cause a CPU and GPU bottleneck as I only get about 45% GPU usage and stay under 10% load in most AAA titles like Destiny or Call of Duty.CinebenchR23 BenchmarksUsing CINEBENCH R23 I got a score of 27552 which is roughly 70 % of top performing CPU score of  43640.Using Geek Bench 6 testI got a Single core score of 2601 which is roughly 83 % of top performing CPU score of  3097 And a multi-core score of 12821 which is roughly 56 % of top performing CPU score of  21742,31 October 2023,Positive

The temps were at 89 to 92°C after the deep cool AIO under stress, test and bench testing the temp stay under 60°C , other than that I game hard on it and stream and the CPU usage never goes past 30%.

No title,No rating,"It's great, I'm using 13900k but wanted a better cpu for my 2nd PC, and it's great, especially for compute tasks and multi-threaded workloads. The raptor lake,  and forthcoming, will of course be better, but if you need the best Alder Lake CPU and can find a decent deal, it won't let you down. I'm able to cool it efficiently with a Noctua N-14 (single stack, single fan setup) and it works great.",26 May 2023,Positive
No title,No rating,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7.",11 May 2023,Positive

I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers.",28 April 2023,Positive
No title,No rating,This CPU is power hungry under load but in games the CPU is fast. This also works fine for workstation workloads but this shines in gaming for sure. Also if you have the cooling this CPU can be clocked even higher for better performance. But for this you will need a decent CPU cooler.,19 April 2023,Positive

No title,No rating,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling.",2 January 2023,Positive

I use an NZXT AIO and the temps on this thing are under 20 idle and when I'm gaming on any game it never goes over 45 and usually is in the low 30s. I tried WOW classic, Retail,  Cyberpunk, Spiderman , and regularly play Escape from tarkov and all at 4k max settings and this thing just stays cool and and low usage.
