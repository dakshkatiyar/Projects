No title,No rating,"Worked well so far during my 4months of ownership!It still kinda sad that a similar CPU from 2018 is just 25-40% slower, which for most people is barely noticeable. That is 5y of advancement!",1 May 2024

No title,No rating,"Llegó en el tiempo indicado por Amazon y el currier nacional en mi país, Ecuador. El procesador llegó en perfecto estado sin problemas, ni daños. El cooler del procesador está muy bonito y parece ser muchísimo mejor que mi viejo i5-4460. Ya siento la diferencia con solo estarlo usando un par de días.

No title,No rating,"Arrival inspection finds the CPU box factory seal broken. All else seems somewhat normal although the CPU position in the viewing window was such that part of the information was covered.  This is not normal. The cooler fan was not installed as the thermal paste was intact. This review is for protection purposes only. Should I find that the processor is non-operational, I will assume that some previous buyer returned the defective part for resale.",3 December 2023

No title,No rating,Works great paired with my 3060.,17 September 2023
No title,No rating,The i5-12400 is at a nice spot on the value/performance curve for a homelabber.  Anything lower and you only get four cores. Anything higher and you have to deal with the P-core/E-core dichotomy. The included heatsink/fan combo isn't much to look at but it gets the job done.,14 September 2023

No title,No rating,"This is a decent value 12th gen CPU, but keep in mind when Intel said they would allow ECC on all 12th gen parts on a W680 board they specifically exclude the 12400. You have to go to something like a 12100 or 12500 for that functionality.",3 August 2023

No title,No rating,"Me vino el procesador sólo, no venia en caja ni tampoco traía su disipador, no me gustó ese motivo",13 May 2023
No title,No rating,I wasn't expecting much out of this CPU but it runs 3D CAD software better than my old i7-6700k and completely blows it out of the water with rendering and tool path generation.  For the price it's dang near perfect.  It's about 20% slower at generating tool paths than an i5-12600k but way faster than the previous generation CPUs.  It's definitely a jump forward from the i5-11400 and about equivalent of an i5-11600k or a 10th gen i7,13 May 2023
No title,No rating,"The cpu itself is not an issue, however it is locked which makes it hard to work with when it doesn’t know if it needs to be fully utilized",8 May 2023

No title,No rating,Fast shipping as usual. The whole package seems fine but seems opened before since there were hair/dust on the paste. I had to clean off the stock paste. Lucky me I had a thermal paste on hand and really needed to use it or I would have returned it. Very disappointed on a 250$ purchase on a cpu. Not gonna buy something important again.,11 April 2023

No title,No rating,"If you're looking to save money but also want an extremely competent and reliable processor in 2023. The 12400 is a safe pick. I run this with a RX 6600 XT and I can stream a 1080p/60FPS game in HIGH/ULTRA settings, watch streams on the side and download a game on steam at the same time with no CPU bottleneck. Need I say more?",24 February 2023

No title,No rating,"This CPU wasn't my first choice, was aiming for the F version but for the time being I needed a CPU to finish my rig and bought this one, so far it's been almost 4 months and everything is working perfectly, paired it with 32GB RAM from Corsair and an ASUS TUF GAMING B660-plus wifi d4, not using the stock cooler but temps stay on the low 40s and never reaches more than 60 degrees.

No title,No rating,"don't hesitate one second before replacing with a vertical cooler. A 120 mm model, selling for $39, was easier to install, lowered idle temps from 50 to 25 deg C, and is silent. What more can be said?",24 December 2022
No title,No rating,"You get more cores than an i3 based cpu. If you want to save a lot, you could go with a 12100f, but I think you get a lot of value with this cpu. You get the faster pcie lanes and more of them compared to the 10th and 11th gen cpus. And you can use a single fan low profile heatsink and fan with this and get around 75c temperatures during cpu stress tests. When the 13400 comes out though, this might not be worth it depending on the price it comes out with, but for now you get a great value and great performance.",7 December 2022
No title,No rating,8世代、10世代から比べるとワタシ的な使用では現状十分な性能を持っているので買ってよかったかな。発売当初より高値になったがまだコスパ的には13世代より良い気もする。っていうか13世代が高すぎる…。ただ配送に関しては多少の不満も。cpuのような精密機器を相変わらずの薄い紙袋で送るのは是非考え直して頂きたい。当然だがcpuの箱の四隅はボロボロで届いた。。,2 December 2022
