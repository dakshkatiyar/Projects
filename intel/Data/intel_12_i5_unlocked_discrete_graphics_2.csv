All else seems somewhat normal although the CPU position in the viewing window was such that part of the information was covered.  This is not normal.

No title,No rating,The i5-12400 is at a nice spot on the value/performance curve for a homelabber.  Anything lower and you only get four cores. Anything higher and you have to deal with the P-core/E-core dichotomy. The included heatsink/fan combo isn't much to look at but it gets the job done.,14 September 2023

No title,No rating,"This is a decent value 12th gen CPU, but keep in mind when Intel said they would allow ECC on all 12th gen parts on a W680 board they specifically exclude the 12400. You have to go to something like a 12100 or 12500 for that functionality.",3 August 2023

No title,No rating,I wasn't expecting much out of this CPU but it runs 3D CAD software better than my old i7-6700k and completely blows it out of the water with rendering and tool path generation.  For the price it's dang near perfect.  It's about 20% slower at generating tool paths than an i5-12600k but way faster than the previous generation CPUs.  It's definitely a jump forward from the i5-11400 and about equivalent of an i5-11600k or a 10th gen i7,13 May 2023

No title,No rating,Fast shipping as usual. The whole package seems fine but seems opened before since there were hair/dust on the paste. I had to clean off the stock paste. Lucky me I had a thermal paste on hand and really needed to use it or I would have returned it. Very disappointed on a 250$ purchase on a cpu. Not gonna buy something important again.,11 April 2023

No title,No rating,"You get more cores than an i3 based cpu. If you want to save a lot, you could go with a 12100f, but I think you get a lot of value with this cpu.

And you can use a single fan low profile heatsink and fan with this and get around 75c temperatures during cpu stress tests. When the 13400 comes out though, this might not be worth it depending on the price it comes out with, but for now you get a great value and great performance.",7 December 2022
