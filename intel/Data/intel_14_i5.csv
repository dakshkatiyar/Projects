It's a beast for all kind of works,5.0 out of 5 stars,When compare to amd ryzen 7 7000 processors i5 14600k will easily beat in all aspects. But this will consume a lot of power and generate more heat. So we have to take atleast 700W with 80+ certified psu and a good liquid cooler. Any how As usually we can enjoy with this beast.,30 October 2023

No title,No rating,"Works just fine.  Looking back you can get pretty similar performance on a 13th gen and save like $30, or go up to the I7 which gives you two more performance cores.  It is working great though and cooler than the 14 gen I7 and I9.",3 April 2024
No title,No rating,Paired with a discounted Z690 board for gaming. New build posted and I updated the bios for this chip. No issues. Will update for experience of how it does with my 4070Ti Super.,1 April 2024
No title,No rating,Paired with a 360 MSI AIO this 14700K never gets out of the 50’sC area. Most everyone(AMD fanboys) wants you to believe these run very hot and they don’t. Get a good cooler and you’ll be fine. Runs any game I throw at it just paired with a 4090.,6 March 2024

No title,No rating,"I got this CPU because I've been a long term Intel user and I have never had problems with them. This one replaced my i7 8700k and it is noticeably faster for my daily work (mostly Office, Internet content) and gaming (COD MW3). In terms of power consumption and heat generation, I can hardly notice it since all the workload I put on it hardly heats it up more than 45C-50C. I'm not a video/photo content creator nor a streamer, so this works for me. For example, while playing COD MW3 and Ultra settings the CPU use is about 2% while my GPU, RTX 3080, carries 98% of the bottleneck workload.",2 January 2024
