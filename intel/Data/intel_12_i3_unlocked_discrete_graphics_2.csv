Best budget processor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best processor you could find under 8k , it beats most processors which are more expensive than this one.. overall great for gaming in this price range",11 May 2023
Great,5.0 out of 5 stars,Working fine and great performance 😊,22 February 2023
Works flawlessly,5.0 out of 5 stars,The processor works with MSI H610M-B DDR4 Micro-ATX out of the box. The processor comes with a heatsink with fan and thermal paste is also present under the heatsink. No need to buy thermal paste.,24 September 2022
No title,No rating,Very nice CPU for light gaming! However the packaging it came with was terrible they just threw it on a plastic bag and ship it. This is unacceptable!,2 July 2024
No title,No rating,Works like a charm. For all my Steam Games it works very well. Did some benchmarking and got very decent numbers. I used it with 16 MB DDR4 3200 MHz RAM and an RTX 2060 I had lying around. Used Valley and Supposition with VSYNC on for 1080P and had solid 60 FPS. VSYNC off got 80 to 100 FPS. CPU usage was never above 25 percent.,30 June 2024

No title,No rating,"Très bon produit, rapport qualité prix parfait, je recommande",27 May 2024
No title,No rating,Getting over 100fps and even 150fps in some cases with a 6600XT OC (while keeping VRAM usage under 6gb of course) on new games.This is a great CPU if you're on a budget,22 May 2024
No title,No rating,"We only bought this to update BIOS on a new motherboard in order to use a newer CPU.  This lil guy was a perfect solution to not further cripple our collective wallets, and we got the update run at long last!  And now we have a spare CPU in case disaster strikes... again.",16 May 2024

No title,No rating,Amazon sent a broken item to me.,11 May 2024
No title,No rating,"Sure you can pay more to get a cpu that’s better at complex tasks like video editing, but for more gaming this is able to carry even a midrange gpu easily.It’s very low cost too.",8 May 2024
No title,No rating,"Bought as a test CPU to see if motherboard was working, didn't use long, but seemed to be a good sub-$100 option.",7 May 2024

No title,No rating,I returned the item because it wasnt good nor did it work for my pc and they never gave my money back,29 April 2024
No title,No rating,Really good for budget builds,21 April 2024
No title,No rating,"Performs as expected, but you do need a GPU for video output. Just spend the $30 for the iGPU (i-3 12100) version (works great as a Plex/Emby/Jellyfin/etc media server).",18 April 2024
No title,No rating,"I used this to build a pc for my wife. The performance on this CPU (depending on supporting hardware) matches or exceeds many CPUs available at both similar and higher price points. If you are truly going for a budget build, it is hard to beat this below $100.I built her system with 16GB of DDR4 3200 ram, and an RX 6600 for the GPU, and she has no problem running anything either gaming or productivity.I don’t recommend going as cheap as you can on the motherboard, if you get this though. The performance on this can be great but you have to get supporting hardware to maximize it.",13 April 2024
No title,No rating,Packing already open. CPU in protect case not right position so protected case pust connect area. Heat sink not cleat and every where in CPU front and back. Box already open and fan is dirty. Original heat sink been used. I really don't mind if work but if not working I will return.,11 April 2024
No title,No rating,works well for low end gaming pc if paired with a 6650 for me love it,8 April 2024
No title,No rating,esta bien,1 April 2024
No title,No rating,"This cpu is part of my upgrade from socket 1200 to socket 1700. This cpu is noticeably faster than the one it replaced, a 10th generation Intel i5. This cpu runs very cool and provides plenty of power for my everyday computing needs, which do not include gaming. My system currently runs the Zorin OS (Linux) smoothly and efficiently with temperatures sometimes under 30 degrees. Just remember that with this cpu you need a graphics card as the chip does not have that component. It is a nice touch that this cpu is compatible with either DDR4 or DDR5 memory. Just check the standards for the motherboard you intend to purchase. Best of luck with building your own desktop.",24 March 2024
No title,No rating,Its a damn good budget CPU. Great for 1080p -1440p gaming and everyday use with low power draw and heat output. No IGPU so you'll need a GPU of some kind in your build but that's about it,23 March 2024
No title,No rating,"CPU is bad and used, Today open the box. the cpu came in a new box, but the cpu was broken. This is a real scam.!!!!",22 March 2024

No title,No rating,Works perfect 👍🏼,17 January 2024
No title,No rating,Good enough to game with and under 100$,9 January 2024
No title,No rating,予算の都合でこの世代のi3にゲームができるのでこれでいいかなと買いました。ゲームはできるのでいいですがわりと処理量がすぐに多くなり94%と処理が追いつけないことが時にはあるので今後は同じ世代のか次の世代のi5に乗り換えようと考えています。その他はとく問題にあたるところはないので良いと思います。,6 January 2024
No title,No rating,"My oldest ordered this for a PC he built on hiw own, with all the parts needed. He happy with it",3 January 2024
No title,No rating,"Bought this for my modernity pack coming from an AMD hex-core. This little quad core slaps the FX series around in almost very manner, including lower power consumption. Pair this with a decent MoBo and RAM, and you have a great foundation. My only complaint, and it's small, but they don't include any thermal paste in the box, but meh.",2 January 2024
No title,No rating,"If you're building a PC on a budget, and don't want to go with AMD, this isn't a bad option. Will play optimized AAA titles just fine, but I would recommend this to more of an e-sports gamer or someone who enjoys older titles. If you're in the market for a streaming system or a media center, AMD has much better offerings.",2 January 2024

No title,No rating,旧世代のトップクラスのCPU並みの性能なのでそこそこ優秀。4070Tiぐらいの組み合わせならそこまでボトルネックにならず動くものも多いです。4090だとさすがに処理が追い付かなくはなりますがそれでも数％ダウンぐらいなので消費電力を考えれば頑張ってる方でしょう。手軽に安くゲーミングPC作るならおすすめ,26 November 2023
No title,No rating,"I loved the i3-12100f because it is very cheap, but performs and likely wont bottleneck any of your GPUs (Unless your using a 4090 or sum). I saw fps numbers well above the hundred mark when playing many triple A titles, and it can go over 2 to even 3 hundred fps on esport titles. I paired it with a 6650xt",24 November 2023

No title,No rating,CPU is amazing for it's price. Decent performance compared to the predecessors. Pack it with RX 6600 and you will be happy playing your favourite games without hassle.,23 November 2023
No title,No rating,Good cpu but the cooler was a pain to install.,19 November 2023
No title,No rating,Great product fast shipping,9 November 2023
No title,No rating,I was shocked by the incredible performance of this CPU. I love it. Incredible performance in a small package,27 October 2023
No title,No rating,"I didnt expect much from an i3, but once again I was blinded by the label. This product holds the price to performance of a console KILLER. It's single core power is up there with the ryzen 7000 series processors, supporting ddr5 ram at only 90 dollars WITH the cooler. Assuming your average cooler is about 10 dollars, you really can't go wrong with an 84 dollar cpu capable of 500+ fps on minecraft, 300+ fps on valorant, etc.I will say though, a quad core cpu in 2023 is a bit questionable, since you'll have extra issues streaming and recording games. The cache is also pretty low for this cpu, but you really can't hate too much on a 90 dollar cpu at this magnitude of performance.Overall solid cpu, more than I need for games and editing. DONT BE BLINDED BY THE I3 LABEL, IT PERFORMS UP THERE WITH RYZEN CPUS AND 10TH GEN I7S!!!",22 October 2023
No title,No rating,Muy bueno,21 October 2023
No title,No rating,Ich kann diese CPU nur zum Spielen bestens Empfehlen. Warum? Weil die meisten Games nur 4-6 Cores Verwenden. Der i3 12100f ist perfekt für eine sparsame Endleistung. Ich nutze diese CPU in Verbindung mit einer RX6650XT und spiele Far Cry 6 ( Ultra Settings ) mit 100 FPS. Die CPU ist extrem Sparsam. Eine superschnelle Kombination.,20 October 2023
No title,No rating,ottimo a prezzo davvero conveniente! passato da i7 2600 c'è un bel salto di qualità,16 October 2023
No title,No rating,Overall CPU looks to work good still in BIOS but came to realize one of the CPU fan blades broke and when in turbo mode it makes the whole PC vibrate. Hoping to be sent a new cpu cooler or fan.,15 October 2023
No title,No rating,"It’s an intel processor, it’s gonna work, and it’s gonna work as expected. Good product, package was fairly banged up and the cpu is shipped visible at the top of the box standard from intel, I was lucky the cpu didn’t get damaged, cause the box sure did",15 October 2023
No title,No rating,This is a great CPU to buy. It is good value. It also gives me high performance in gaming. It was also easy to set up. So far it has no problems.,8 October 2023

No title,No rating,Work as expected but no video in case bios display is lost .,27 September 2023
No title,No rating,Lo compré porque creía que la nueva arquitectura y las nuevas tecnologías que traía la 12va generación de Intel serían muy diferente y más potente que las generaciones anteriores pero en mi caso solo hubo un rendimiento de alrededor de un 5% con este procesador.,24 September 2023
No title,No rating,Probably the best 100 dollar cpu out there.,22 September 2023
No title,No rating,"It is exactly what it shows and described on the promo. Works like a charm. I'm even surprised myself of how great is performing in my system. Comes with the whole shebang ready to install and also comes ready to install on the motherboard (Silver Thermal Grease CPU Heatsink Compound Paste). No need to put anything, just peel off the plastic and install... Awesome.",21 September 2023
No title,No rating,"I was building a PC and I was on a budget. Not very high budget. I picked this up for $119 Canadian. Overall, this thing is flipping awesome! Outperforms the slightly more expensive Ryzen 5 5500!",19 September 2023

No title,No rating,"I have this installed in an ASUS PRIME PLUS-D4 with an M.2 970 EVO Pro 1TB, ZOTAC 2080, 32GB VulcanC DDR4, AZZA Spectra 280 case with 7 fans.  Running 1080P maxed out CyberPunk 2077 @ 57-60fps WHILE streaming was more than I thought this 'lil dude could handle.

No title,No rating,"I’ve paired it with a RX 7600. Works pretty well with it. I’ve not experienced any issues so far.You may push to get a i5-12400F for higher cores if your budget allows it. Otherwise, this is a great starting point for a budget PC build.",9 September 2023
No title,No rating,"the i3-10100f’s main flaw was the small cache size of 6mo… this one has 12mo… which is a massive uplift in stability when gaming… and speaking of gaming…. the cooler it comes with ( idk why but one of the 4 push pins never wanted to be fully pushed ) well… playing gta 5 at 120fps led me to 85-92 degrees on the cpu…… sorry but this is not a laptop, this is unacceptable…………..get ready for a cooler upgrade, i can’t believe they even give this but twice bigger for the i9’s… oof…. struggling under 35w load, that’s pathetic",6 September 2023
No title,No rating,"LLegó bien y en su caja, sólo que después de adquirirlo pensé en cambiarlo y como yo debía pagar el embalaje, prefería quedármelo. Si la diferencia de precio con el procesador con gráficos integrados es mínima, sería mejor idea adquirir el otro modelo",2 September 2023

No title,No rating,"Amazing cpu for less then 100$. I put this into my build and it is VERY fast. I can play any game with no issues paired with Rx 6600. I would recommend upgrading to a better cpu in a year or 2 like a 12400F, but it isn’t necessary. If u are building a budget build then this is an awesome choice tho it will slowdown on you in a year or 2 so that’s why I’m gonna upgrade to 12400F soon",8 August 2023

No title,No rating,This CPU was priced right for my new build. Only problem I had was mounting the stock fan to the motherboard.,3 August 2023
No title,No rating,"My last I3 was the gen 9, so jumping to 12 and seeing that its a PINLESS CPU (pins are on the motherboard) was a big surprise and a bit of a relief. Overall I am damned happy with the upgrade, its not a top end gaming PC but its more than enough. I don't do competitive FPS games, RTX lighting is obnoxious as well as motion blur - basically purty graphics and good performance is what matters.That said the one complaint I do have falls on Amazon. You'd think that a processor would be packaged in a box with some protective wrapping right? Nope. Paper bag with no bubble wrap that also arrived torn. The fact that the RAM didn't fall out the hole and that the CPU works fine is a relief.",3 August 2023
