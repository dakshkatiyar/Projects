No title,No rating,"This is a nice processor that I use in a dev box.  I have it air cooled and can play Minecraft with shaders all day on it with my 4080GTX and 128 gigs of memory.  The only issue I have is probably my own fault, in that I learned that intel did that stunt where they introduced P and E cores.  I'm not sure if they are making straight performance core models by the time I write this but if you are a rabid gamer make sure you are getting that type of proc and not this proc.  Still, this proc will do just fine for me as I use this for hyper-v and development work.  I'm sure it will play all the latest games just fine. and If it doesn't I can just pop in a different proc.",23 June 2024
No title,No rating,Works great in new build! Only slight issue is I felt like there wasn't quite enough thermal paste... I had some leftover from a previous build so I added some additional just to be safe.,20 June 2024
No title,No rating,I was afraid to purchase the 14th gen after all the talk of stability issues. When the the Bios fixes were mentioned I took a shot. I'm up and running with the power limits adjusted accordingly.,14 June 2024
No title,No rating,"Nachdem ich meinen PC mit dem Intel Core i9-14900KF aufgerüstet habe, kann ich sagen, dass dieser Prozessor ein echtes Kraftpaket ist. Hier sind meine Eindrücke nach intensiver Nutzung:Leistung:Mit seinen 24 Kernen und einer beeindruckenden Taktrate liefert der i9-14900KF eine unglaubliche Leistung. Egal ob beim Gaming, bei der Videobearbeitung oder beim Multitasking – dieser Prozessor meistert alles mühelos. In Spielen wie Cyberpunk 2077 und Red Dead Redemption 2 laufen die Grafiken butterweich, selbst bei höchsten Einstellungen. Die Ladezeiten sind minimal und das Gameplay ist absolut flüssig.Multitasking:Ich arbeite oft mit mehreren anspruchsvollen Anwendungen gleichzeitig – von Adobe Premiere Pro über Photoshop bis hin zu Blender. Der i9-14900KF bewältigt diese Aufgaben ohne ins Schwitzen zu geraten. Selbst wenn ich ein Video rendere und gleichzeitig in einem anderen Fenster an einem großen Bildbearbeitungsprojekt arbeite, bleibt das System reaktionsschnell und stabil.Kühlung:Apropos Kühlung – der i9-14900KF kann unter Last ziemlich warm werden. Ich habe mich für eine hochwertige Wasserkühlung von NZXT entschieden (Kraken 360 Elite), um die Temperaturen im Griff zu behalten. Mit dieser AIO bleibt der Prozessor auch bei intensiven Gaming-Sessions oder langen Renderzeiten kühl und leise.Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis:Der Preis des i9-14900KF ist sicherlich nicht niedrig, aber angesichts der gebotenen Leistung halte ich ihn für gerechtfertigt. Für Enthusiasten und Profis, die maximale Performance benötigen, ist dieser Prozessor eine lohnende Investition.Fazit:Der Intel Core i9-14900KF ist ein absolutes Monster in Sachen Leistung. Ob beim Gaming, bei kreativen Arbeiten oder beim Multitasking – dieser Prozessor liefert konstant beeindruckende Ergebnisse. Die Möglichkeit zur Übertaktung bietet zusätzlichen Spielraum für Performance-Enthusiasten.

No title,No rating,"In 2020 I made the mistake of switching to AMD. The system I built was so annoying. The fan would increase and decrease speed depending on the load, and it literally made the processor wait for the fan--at least that's how it seemed. Slowed everything down and made a lot of unnecessary noise. With my new Intel-based system, those issues are gone, and I have a lightning fast PC. Learned my lesson about AMD!",9 June 2024
No title,No rating,Products work well but runs very hot. Tribal packaging tho the only Protection was a piece of crumpled paper. The cpu wasn't even in the packaging it had folen out and was just tumbling around the box when it arrived. luckily didn't have any noticeable damage though,5 June 2024
No title,No rating,AMAZING AND RECEIVED SO QUICK! <3,2 June 2024
No title,No rating,Defective from manufacturer constant game crashes because of power throttle issue. Intel needs to recall this product and refund everyone.  I replaced every part on my new PC build only to find out the issues was this Intel CPU (amazon 30 day warranty had already expired by then).  I'm now having to wait for months attempting to get a refund from intel.  This is a well-known issue and Intel refuses to admit and recall product,2 June 2024
No title,No rating,"The 13th and 14th gen intel cpu chips are notorious for being unstable and low quality. While installation is easy, the chip may come with deficiencies that get worse over time.For the first couple months after install i would experience BSoD crashes and i was trying to diagnose. Now 2 months later the computer will no longer boot without BSoD. All other hardware has been replaced meaning the chip is absolutely the issue. Currently in the process of RMA negotiations with intel because diagnosis took longer than the amazon return window. So far their service has been slow to respond. Until intel admits to the faults in these generations and offers an actual fix i would suggest sticking to AMD. I wish i had.I personally never overclocked the card, never had the chance, it wasn't very stable on default settings. Had a ticket with intel since 3 days ago, they havent reaponded in 2 days.

No title,No rating,"I have this CPU on an ASUS z790 Hero MB with a H150i 360mm AIO cooler. This cpu temp spikes and throttles like crazy under high load. Using Thermal Grizzly paste as well. I have built competition systems for over a decade. This is not normal... Been following the online ""declocking"" and ""undervolting"" and that is unacceptable.",4 May 2024

No title,No rating,"I'm a game developer and decided to switch from AMD to Intel for my latest build. The amount of problems this CPU has caused me has cost me hundreds of hours of work. I've been building computers for over 20 years and this is by far the absolute worst component of all time. E cores will cause instability in almost every multithreaded application, clocking has to be severely limited to avoid blue screen of death, Intel Extreme Tuning Utility is borderline malware, and the high thread count is just deceptive marketing because 1/3 of the cores are laptop grade. It gave the illusion of stability through the return period so I'm now stuck with a $500 paper weight CPU and motherboard.",17 April 2024
No title,No rating,Like the idea of no onboard video heating up the processor.  The irony is i have a Asus pro art MB 750 model that does the integration of components. My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad. Enjoying my thermal right air cooler it does a great job for half the cost of my older noctua cooler on my prior haswell i7.,5 April 2024

No title,No rating,"The listing for this product claims that you don't need a discrete graphics card. This is incorrect, the KF model does not bring an onboard graphics card. This wasted my time and slowed down the timeline for my NAS build by 3 whole days. Thanks.",14 February 2024
No title,No rating,Even throw the win11 the E cores will still lower the gamming performence in the games like escape from tarkov& others.But the Cpu is doing great,1 February 2024
No title,No rating,"I had a minor hiccup with my new 14900KF, but I contacted Intel and their customer service was fantastic. They sent me a new one and it's working great now. This thing is like a buzz saw in gaming. I have a negative offset on the voltage of -0.0500v and the hottest I've seen it get was 62c while playing Horizon Zero Dawn maxed at 4K. It was getting as high as 190 FPS every now and then. This CPU is brutal man. Top flight customer service too.",31 January 2024
No title,No rating,"May be a little excessive and unnecessary, but glad I got one when I did.  Sometimes these things get hard to acquire, especially at a decent price.Seems to run a little hotter than my Ryzen 9 7950X, so I went with dual 420mm,  If you buy this CPU you should really consider custom loops or large cases with 420mm AIO support.",18 January 2024
No title,No rating,Installs easily and works fast and well.  No problems - just the way I like it.,15 January 2024
No title,No rating,"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip.",11 January 2024

No title,No rating,"Does as intended. Topped the stock benchmark stats. It's a heater but the I9s are the top performs. Recommend no smaller than a 360 cooler, I went Artic due to the increased width of their radiator core. Top temp (tuned) 95c but will play most games in the 65c range. VR put a greater heat of 91c max but the flight sim was beautiful and smooth as can be with water takeoffs and landings. This was an upgrade to a 12700kf that I chose awaiting the 14 generation processors. I have this combined with a Nvidea 4080 on a MSI z690 board with 64gb ddr4.  Smooth gaming.",10 December 2023

No title,No rating,Great processor!,27 November 2023
No title,No rating,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",3 November 2023
